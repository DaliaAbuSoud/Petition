            This petition is to support an ambitious and hard working woman who is trying to find a spot in this world where she 
            can leave her unique fingure print. <br>
            Dalia Abu-Soud, is a 35 years old finance expert who moved to Berlin from Jordan in 2017.
            Due to language barrier, it was hard for Dalia to get a job in finance in Berlin. She then took 
            the decision of a career shift to web development and enrolled in 2020 to one of the best coding 
            schools in Berlin. Due to the lack of previous tech knowlage and experience, Dalia had to spent 
            hours and hours of hard work to be able to graduate and become a good web developer.<br>
            After spending 4 weeks at this school, Dalia was infomred that the school won't be able give her a 
            graduation certificate as she was accused of commiting frogery in copying code from an online open

            one of the Youtube coding videos for the purpose of understanding, self-studying and practicing.
