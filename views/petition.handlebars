            <p>Dalia Abu-Soud, 35 years old finance expert who moved from Jordan to Berlin in 2017.
            Due to language barrier, it was hard for Dalia to get a job in finance. In 2020, Dalia decieded not to stop
            and give up, but to dump finance and start all over again. She then enrolled in a web development bootcamp. 
            Due to the lack of her previous tech knowlage, Dalia had to put extra effort to be able to graduate and become 
            a good web developer.<br>
            On her 3rd week in this bootcamp, and for the purpose of better understanding and extra practice, Dalia watched
            a YouTube programing video while solving one of the daily excersises. She coded along, learned extra methods & 
            finally added more code form what she have learned in class.
            Unfortunately, some days later, Dalia was accused of commiting frogery in copying code and was banned from getting
            a graduation certificate.
