            <p class="the-text">A 35 years old finance expert who moved from the Middle East to Germany in 2017.
            Finance in Deutsch is definitely not easy ðŸ˜Ž which made it hard for her to find a job in the field of her experties.

            In 2020, she decieded not to stop and not give up but to dump finance and to start all over again.
            She then enrolled into a web development bootcamp, but due to the lack of her tech knowlage, she had to put extra effort to work harder than others.<br>

            <br>On her 3rd week in this bootcamp, and for the purpose of better understanding and extra practice, she watched a coding related YouTube video to help her better understand a certain coding method to solve one of the daily exercises. She coded
            along, learned extra methods & finally added more code form what she have learned in class.
            Unfortunately, some days later, she was accused of commiting frogery in copying code. She tried explaining over and over again that she was coding along with this youtube coder for the purpose of learning and that she did not copy the code as is, but sadley, there was no cooperation from this academy and she was banned from getting a graduation certificate<br>
