            <p class="The-Story"> The Story...</p>
            <p>Dalia, 35 years old finance expert who moved from Jordan to Berlin in 2017.</p>
            Finance in Deutsch is definitely not easy ðŸ˜Ž and it made it hard for her to find a job in finance.

            In 2020, Dalia decieded not to stop and give up, but to dump finance and start all over again.
            She then enrolled in a web development bootcamp.
            Due to the lack in her tech knowlage, Dalia had to put extra effort to be able to graduate and become
            a good web developer.<br>
            On her 3rd week in this bootcamp, and for the purpose of better understanding and extra practice, Dalia
            watched a YouTube video of how to build a Carousel to solve one of the daily exercises. She coded
            along, learned
            extra methods & finally added more code form what she have learned in class.
            Unfortunately, some days later, Dalia was accused of commiting frogery in copying code and was banned
            from getting a graduation certificate.<br>

            This webiste is all done by Dalia, 2 weeks of sleepless nights working with JS, NodeJS, EXPRESS,
            HANDLEBARS, HTTP Requests, APIs, JQuery, SQL, Testing, HTML & CSS
            to mkae it as good as possible after
            only 8 weeks in Tech-World!<br>
            </p>
            <p class="conclusion"> This Petiton is Dalia's Accredited Certificate!
