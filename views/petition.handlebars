            <p class="The-Story"> The Story...</p>
            <p>Dalia Abu-Soud, 35 years old finance expert who moved from Jordan to Berlin in 2017.
                Due to language barrier, it was hard for Dalia to get a job in finance. In 2020, Dalia decieded not to
                stop and give up, but to dump finance and start all over again. She then enrolled in a web development
                bootcamp.
                Due to the lack in her tech knowlage, Dalia had to put extra effort to be able to graduate and become
                a good web developer.<br>
                On her 3rd week in this bootcamp, and for the purpose of better understanding and extra practice, Dalia
                watched a YouTube programing video while solving one of the daily excersises. She coded along, learned
                extra
                methods & finally added more code form what she have learned in class.
                Unfortunately, some days later, Dalia was accused of commiting frogery in copying code and was banned
                from getting a graduation certificate.<br>

                This webiste is all done by Dalia, 2 weeks of sleepless night to mkae it as good as she could do after
                only 8 weeks in Tech-World!<br>
                This petiton is what she will consider as an accredited certificate.
